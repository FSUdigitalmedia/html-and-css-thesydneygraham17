    <h1>Strawberry Shortcake Recipe</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350, and lightly grease an 8×8 pan or 10 spaces on a muffin tin. </li>
    <li>Cream the butter and sugar with a spoon, beating well until the mixture is light and slightly fluffy. About 40 strokes around the bowl or so.</li>
    <li>Add the buttermilk,eggs and vanilla and mix well.</li>
    <li>Using a sifter sitting over the bowl, add the flour, salt, and baking powder to the sifter and tap the dry ingredients into the wet ones.</li>
    <li>Mix with a spoon until no dry clumps of flour remain.</li>
    <li>Bake 25-30 minutes for the 8×8 pan or 15-20 minutes for the muffin tin until the cake springs back and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
    <li>Serve slightly warm with fresh strawberries and whipped cream.</li>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>You can reduce the amount of sugar, but don't go below a half cup, because it will ruin the structure of it.</p>

    <p> Try to get fresh strawberries and cut them in half, they'll taste and look better!
    </p>

    <p>If you can, try making your own whipped cream. It'll contain less oil and more dairy!</p>
    
    <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
